# Documentation Guidance

Guidelines for documenting issues during a dogfood session. Every issue must be reproducible with evidence.

## Core Principles

- **Repro is everything.** Every issue needs proof -- but match the evidence to the issue.
- **Verify reproducibility before collecting evidence.** Before recording video or taking screenshots, verify the issue is reproducible with at least one retry. If it can't be reproduced consistently, it's not a valid issue.
- **Write findings incrementally.** Append each issue to the report as you discover it. If the session is interrupted, findings are preserved. Never batch all issues for the end.
- **Never delete output files.** Do not `rm` screenshots, videos, or the report mid-session. Do not close the session and restart. Work forward, not backward.

## Evidence Types

### Interactive / Behavioral Issues

These require user interaction to reproduce -- use full repro with video and step-by-step screenshots:

1. **Start a repro video** _before_ reproducing:

```bash
agent-browser --session {SESSION} record start {OUTPUT_DIR}/videos/issue-{NNN}-repro.webm
```

2. **Walk through the steps at human pace.** Pause 1-2 seconds between actions so the video is watchable. Take a screenshot at each step:

```bash
agent-browser --session {SESSION} screenshot {OUTPUT_DIR}/screenshots/issue-{NNN}-step-1.png
sleep 1
# Perform action (click, fill, etc.)
sleep 1
agent-browser --session {SESSION} screenshot {OUTPUT_DIR}/screenshots/issue-{NNN}-step-2.png
sleep 1
# ...continue until the issue manifests
```

3. **Capture the broken state.** Pause so the viewer can see it, then take an annotated screenshot:

```bash
sleep 2
agent-browser --session {SESSION} screenshot --annotate {OUTPUT_DIR}/screenshots/issue-{NNN}-result.png
```

4. **Stop the video:**

```bash
agent-browser --session {SESSION} record stop
```

5. Write numbered repro steps in the report, each referencing its screenshot.

### Static / Visible-on-Load Issues

These are visible without interaction -- a single annotated screenshot is sufficient. No video, no multi-step repro:

```bash
agent-browser --session {SESSION} screenshot --annotate {OUTPUT_DIR}/screenshots/issue-{NNN}.png
```

Write a brief description and reference the screenshot in the report. Set **Repro Video** to `N/A`.

## Don'ts

- **Don't record video for static issues.** A typo or clipped text doesn't benefit from a video. Save video for issues that involve user interaction, timing, or state changes.
- **Don't read the target app's source code.** You are testing as a user, not auditing code. Do not read HTML, JS, or config files of the app under test. All findings must come from what you observe in the browser.
- **Don't skip the console.** Many issues are invisible in the UI but show up as JS errors or failed requests.

## Report Template Structure

Each issue should include:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | critical / high / medium / low |
| **Category** | visual / functional / ux / content / performance / console / accessibility |
| **URL** | {page URL where issue was found} |
| **Repro Video** | {path to video, or N/A for static issues} |

**Description**: What is wrong, what was expected, and what actually happened.

**Repro Steps**: Numbered steps, each referencing its screenshot. A reader should be able to follow along visually.
